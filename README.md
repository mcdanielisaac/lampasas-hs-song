# Lampasas High School
## School Song


Lampasas High to you we're proudly singing.
Our voices raise to you in highest praise.
We love each stone, your ivy covered entrance,
Where all our youth, we struggle to succeed.

The sportsmanship, the loyalty, the teachers,
The colors of our tried old white and blue,
And through the years we'll labor to retain them,
And to our alma mater we will be true.
